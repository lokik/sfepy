  example, etc.), see :ref:`release notes <2015.3-2015.4>`.

* **23.09.2015** Version 2015.3 released (preliminary support for parallel
  computing, unified evaluation of basis functions (= isogeometric analysis
  fields can be evaluated in arbitrary points), (mostly) fixed finding of
  reference element coordinates of physical points, several new or improved
  examples, etc.), see :ref:`release notes <2015.2-2015.3>`.

* **29.05.2015** Version 2015.2 released (major code simplification (removed
  element groups), time stepping solvers updated for interactive use, improved
  finding of reference element coordinates of physical points, reorganized
  examples, reorganized installation on POSIX systems (sfepy-run script),
