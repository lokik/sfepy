* **24.02.2016** Version 2016.1 released (major simplification of finite
  element field code, automatic checking of shapes of term arguments, improved
  mesh parametrization code and documentation, support for fieldsplit
  preconditioners of PETSc, etc.), see :ref:`release notes <2015.4-2016.1>`.

* **01.12.2015** Version 2015.4 released (basic support for restart files,
  new type of linear combination boundary conditions, balloon inflation
  example, etc.), see :ref:`release notes <2015.3-2015.4>`.

* **23.09.2015** Version 2015.3 released (preliminary support for parallel
  computing, unified evaluation of basis functions (= isogeometric analysis
  fields can be evaluated in arbitrary points), (mostly) fixed finding of
  reference element coordinates of physical points, several new or improved
  examples, etc.), see :ref:`release notes <2015.2-2015.3>`.

* **29.05.2015** Version 2015.2 released (major code simplification (removed
  element groups), time stepping solvers updated for interactive use, improved
  finding of reference element coordinates of physical points, reorganized
  examples, reorganized installation on POSIX systems (sfepy-run script),
  etc.), see :ref:`release notes <2015.1-2015.2>`.

* **26.02.2015** Version 2015.1 released (support for multiple fields in
  isogeometric analysis, redesigned handling of solver parameters, new modal
  analysis example, etc.), see :ref:`release notes <2014.4-2015.1>`.
